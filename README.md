# Classification-Model-using-Different-Metrics
This is Binary Classification Model to Predict target variable median_house_value_is_high which is 0 or 1.
If the predicted median_house_value is less than(<) 265000, median_house_value_is_high =0 else 1.

## Modules used here are:
* Numpy.
* Pandas.
* Scipy (for Normal Distribution representation).
* Matplotlib.
* Tensorflow.

## Metrics used for Evaluating the Model are:

* Accuracy.
* Precision.
* Recall.
* AUC of Reciever Operating Characteristics.

## Confusion Matrix:

 A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known. 
 The confusion matrix itself is relatively simple to understand, but the related terminology can be confusing.

## Metrics with their Formulas:

* Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
* Precision = TP/TP+FP
* Recall = TP/TP+FN
